		<item><title>Dependency hell</title><description>Oh python. The project leader, LeWolfYT, wrote the installer in python. One of the problems with python is dependencies. I mostly write in haxe which bundles the dependencies inside the program. Python does not. This means I have to figure out which dependencies are already included with python and add them to the ISO package list.</description><pubDate>2023-10-19 20:59:27 UTC</pubDate><guid>de86c367-dae2-0f16-6ee1-052c6502</guid><author>SidGames5</author></item>

			<title>Symmetrical OS Installer Development Update #4 - TK</title>

			<description>Our package manager, escam, is almost ready for release! In terms of
				features, everything is complete. There are just a couple bugs we need to work out.

				repositories.</description>
